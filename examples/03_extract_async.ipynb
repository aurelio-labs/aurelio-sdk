We present a model-independent study of the observed mass-radius relationship in WD binaries of Parsons et al. (2017), listing data over a broad temperature range up to about 60,000 K (5 eV). The data show an appreciable temperature sen- sitivity with pronounced intrinsic scatter (beyond measurement uncertainty) for the canonical He-models with proton to neutron ratio 1:1. We characterize temperature sensitivity by a temperature scale T0 in model-agnostic power-law relations with tempera- ture normalized radius. For low-mass WDs, the results identify a remarkably modest T0 = 1   2 eV. We comment on a potential interpretation for atmospheres insulating super-Eddington temperature cores from the sub-Eddington photospheres of low-mass WDs.\\nKeywords: white dwarfs, mass-radius relation, Chandrasekhar\\n1. Introduction\\nWhite dwarfs (WDs) represent the final evolutionary stage of stars with masses in the range of 0.4M  < M < 8M . As such, they are quite numerous. The Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) contains 359,073 WD candidates (Gentile Fusillo et al., 2021). EDR3 extends the survey of 29,294 WDs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16 (DR 16) by over an order of magnitude with 25,176 WDs in both surveys. WDs are variously classified by their atmospheric composition (Gen- tile Fusillo et al. 2021). Most are of type DA characterized by a dominance of hydrogen lines in their spectra. It reveals an opaque hydrogen atmosphere, whose observed temperatures are well below the Eddington limit (Fig. 1).\\nWDs have a distinct mass-radius relationship with a lower bound defined by electron degeneracy pressure (Str omgren, 1939). It is described by the equation of state (EoS) of de- generacy pressure of a Fermi gas, the relativistic limit of which defines the Chandrasekhar mass-limit. To leading order, WDs are modeled by the ideal Fermi gas at zero temperature sur- rounded by a non-degenerate atmosphere (Koester and Chan- mugam, 1990). At zero temperature, the degenerate WD core is effectively parameterized only by a proton-to-neutron ratio. In this limit, the mass-radius relation satisfies (Str omgren, 1939; Hamada and Salpeter, 1961; Koester et al., 1979)\\nR = C0\\n(cid:32)\\nM M \\n(cid:33) 1/3\\nwhere\\nC0 =\\n(cid:32) 16G3m3 e 81 2 6\\n(cid:33) 1/3 (cid:32) Amp Z\\n(cid:33) 5/3\\nM 1/3  \\n  0.01 R ,\\nEmail address: mvp@sejong.ac.kr (Maurice H.P.M. van Putten) 1INAF-OAS Bologna via P. Gobetti 101 I-40129 Bologna Italy, Italy\\n(1)\\n(2)\\nwhere G is Newton s constant,   is Planck s constant, me and mp are the masses of the electron and proton, A is the atomic number and Z denotes the number of protons in a nucleus - here, mostly alpha-nuclei. We have set the A/Z ratio to 2, since many WDs consist of a C/O or He core, the latter in particular expected for low-mass WDs (Iben and Tutukov, 1985; Marsh et al., 1995; Nelemans et al., 2001; Han et al., 2002; Istrate et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2018; Zenati et al., 2019). According to this calculation, R = C0M 1/3 holds.\\nFig. 2 shows the observed mass-radius relation for 26 WDs of type DA, all in eclipsing binaries, sampled by Parsons et al. (2017) by photometric and spectroscopic observations. Photo- metric observations use, for example, the Ultrafast Triple-beam CCD Camera (ULTRACAM, Dhillon et al. 2007) and its spec- troscopic version ULTRASPEC (Dhillon et al., 2014), currently in use as the high-speed imaging photometer on the Thai Na- tional Telescope (TNT). Spectroscopic observations have been performed by X-shooter (Vernet et al., 2011) in ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT).\\nFig. 2 shows the theoretical mass-radius relation of the de- generate core (1) to provide a lower bound. It effectively pro- vides a greatest lower bound only for M/M    0.5, even though it represents an rather elementary model of degeneracy pres- sure. The data clearly show a temperature sensitivity at rel- atively low mass M/M    0.5, see also Fig. 9 in Parsons et al. (2017). Crucially, the temperatures involved (Fig. 1) are far below the characteristic energy 0.1   1 Me V of the Fermi energies of the electrons in the degenerate core. For the present temperature range and low-mass WDs, any finite temperature corrections to the EoS (de Carvalho et al., 2014; Boshkayev, 2018; Boshkayev et al., 2021), including relativis- tic corrections, will be accordingly small for any generaliza- tions beyond (1), notably in Hamada and Salpeter (1961), Ro- tondo et al. (2011), de Carvalho et al. (2014), Boshkayev (2018)\\nPreprint submitted to New Astronomy\\nAugust 29, 2024\\nFigure 1: (Top panel.) Observed, Eddington and core temperatures of the 26 WDs of type DA in the sample of Parsons et al. (2017). Core temperatures are inferred from the Koester (1976) correlation for an optically thick atmosphere, insulating a C/O or He core at super-Eddington temperatures. (Lower panel.) Same data plotted as a function of mass with trends at slope 1.10 (Observed, blue), 1.18 (Eddington, red) and -0.11 (Core, brown). Eddington temperatures are roughly consistent with the geometric mean of observed and core tempera- tures.\\nand Baiko and Yakovlev (2019); see further Koester and Chan- mugam (1990); Koester (2002). Moreover, at sufficiently high density, the mass-radius relationship of the core becomes uni- versal, independent of the details of the EoS.\\nInstead, the origin of temperature sensitivity in the mass- radius relationship may be found in a non-degenerate atmo- sphere, if present. In particular, a finite temperature sensitivity is expected from an atmosphere about a core at super-Eddington temperatures - allowed for a sufficiently massive and optically thick atmospheres (Fontaine et al., 2001).\\nA variety of studies have been conducted to find solutions thereto and gain a deeper understanding of, e.g., an H enve- lope and/or evolution models depending on core composition (Hamada and Salpeter, 1961; Hearn and Mewe, 1976; Verbunt and Rappaport, 1988; Benvenuto and Althaus, 1999; Fontaine\\net al., 2001; Panei et al., 2007; Boshkayev et al., 2015; Par- sons et al., 2017; Kepler et al., 2019; Pei, 2022). Among these studies, various convection theories have been advanced, also to explain cooling times and evolutionary processes of WDs in- cluding the thermal insulation provided by their non-degenerate atmospheres.\\nFor instance, hot WDs in SDSS DR12 have been analyzed with models of cooling and atmospheres (B edard et al., 2020). Non-Local Thermal Equilibrium (non-LTE) atmospheres and synthetic WD spectra reveal a correlation between surface grav- ity and effective temperature.\\nThese modeled approaches, however, are intricate with po- tentially systematic uncertainties in the detailed structure of non-degenerate atmospheres, mediating heat transport by radi- ation and convection (B edard, 2024). For this reason, we set out the present model-agnostic study based on spectroscopic and photometric data, to further our understanding of the mass- radius relationship (Tremblay et al., 2017; Boshkayev et al., 2016).\\nFor the recent sample of 26 WDs of Parsons et al. (2017) (Fig. 2), we set out to derive a temperature scale T0, charac- terizing temperature sensitivity by exploring various power law relations for the mass-radius relations. The resulting T0 may serve as a novel observational constraint in future studies.\\nIn  2, we recall some preliminaries of the Eddington temper- ature and the Koester (1976) correlation of core and observed temperature. In  3, we introduce a temperature normalized ra- dius, to be used in power-law fits to the data based on two cost functions:  2 and residual Standard deviation (STD) defined by minimal least square errors. In  4, introduce three temperature- normalized power-laws and consider their fits to data in the log- log plane to effectively describe the expansion of apparent ra- dius with normalized temperature. In  5, two of the three re- lationships are ranked by probability of significance by Monte Carlo analysis. In  6, we interpret the results and summarize our findings with an outlook for future studies in  7.\\n2. The intermediate Eddington temperature\\nFig. 1 shows, as expected, the observed temperatures T to be strictly below the Eddington temperature, TEdd. After all, the modest observed temperatures on the order of a few eV im- ply the existence of an atmosphere. A reverse inequality would imply rapid evaporation by radiation pressure acting on the op- tically thin outer-most layers of any atmosphere.\\nThe Eddington temperature TEdd is defined by equating the Eddington luminosity LEdd = 3.2   104 (M/M ) L  to the lumi- nosity from a sphere of radius R. That is, LEdd = 4 R2 T 4 Edd, where   = 5.67   10 5g s 3K 4 is the Stefan-Boltzmann con- stant. This defines\\nTEdd = 39.5\\n(cid:32)\\ng 5000 g \\n(cid:33) 1 4\\nby surface gravity g = GM/R2 with a fiducial value for M = 0.5M , R = 2%R , scaled to the solar value g  = GM /R2  .\\n(3)\\nFigure 2: Mass-radius plot with temperature (color) in the sample of 26 WDs of type DA (Parsons et al., 2017). NN Ser is the hottest and SDSS J0138- 0016 is the coldest at 63,000K and, respectively, 3,570 K. For reference, it includes the theoretical zero-temperature limit (1) (dashed black line). The vertical grey region highlights three WDs of essentially the same mass with pronounced expansion in apparent radius with temperature. A significant de- parture is seen between observed and the expected radius (1), especially at low mass M/M    0.5. Included are fits to the data by a model-agnostic power- law Relation-2 (dotted colored curves,  3) studied in the present work with isothermals covering 5,000-65,000 K (bottom to top in steps of 10,000 K) in observed temperature. Relation-2 identifies a characteristic temperature scale T0 = 1   2 eV in the observed mass-radius relationship.\\nFor the sample of Parsons et al. (2017), TEdd in (3) is on-average about 40 times the observed surface temperature T (Fig. 1).\\nThe Eddington temperatures shown are roughly consistent TcT of observed and core tempera- with the geometric mean tures. As such, TEdd provides a natural reference to their corre- lations.\\nFollowing a detailed revisit of WD envelopes for the ob- served temperature T at the surface and the central temperature Tc of the core of the WD, Koester (1976) derives a correlation T 4 = 2.05   10 10 (cid:16) c with index   = 2.56, where T T   is in K. Scaled to TEdd, it takes the form\\ng/cm s 2(cid:17)\\nTc    TEdd\\nwith\\n0.02 M 1/4\\n  = 35.7 R1/2\\n0.5\\n(cid:32)\\n40 T TEdd\\n(cid:33) \\n  = 4/    1.56. Here, we use the notation R = 2% R0.02 R  and M = 0.5 M0.5 M  for a fiducial value and taking into account aforementioned mean ratio of TEdd to T .\\nFig. 1 summarizes the distributions of Tc, TEdd and T for the sample of Parsons et al. (2017). These are well below the Fermi level EF of the degenerate electrons supporting the core with characteristic temperature kBTc = z mpc2   0.1   1 MeV, where z = Rg/R is the gravitational redshift of the WD surface according to its gravitational radius Rg = GM/c2, where mp is the proton mass, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and c is the velocity of light.\\n(4)\\n(5)\\nTable 1: Three WDs of essential the same mass showing a clear increase of observed radius with temperature in the sample of Parsons et al.

Highlighted by color is a general trend of increasing radius with temperature. This trend is particularly striking upon considering similar masses. Table 1 lists three WDs of mass M   0.415M  clearly showing a pronounced correlation of apparent radius expanding by   50% with temperature increasing to   5 eV.\\nIn absolute terms, relative to the Fermi level of the electrons (Fig. 1), these temperatures are extremely modest leaving the star essentially unperturbed (Hamada and Salpeter, 1961). For the present sample of Parsons et al. (2017), this suggests, in- stead, a temperature sensitivity in the H atmosphere of WDs considered previously by modeled approaches in Parsons et al. (2017) more likely so than in the degenerate core. We return to this in  7.\\nHere, we circumvent model assumptions by using generic and model-agnostic power-laws for an effective description by a temperature-normalized radius. In doing so, we derive a char- acteristic temperature scale characterizing temperature sensitiv- ity, blind to the underlying physical origin. To be specific, based on Fig. 1 and Table 1, we consider (cid:33) \\n(cid:32)\\nM M \\nR = R0\\nf (T/T0)\\n(6)\\nwith free parameters ( , T0). Here, f (T/T0) is dimensionless and R0 is a constant fixing the dimension of length.\\nStarting point of our approach are effective mass-radius re- lationships of the form R   M  f (T/T0) for some power-law index   and temperature scale T0. Equivalently, this considers a correlation of mass to the scaled radius\\nR  =\\nR f (T/T0)\\n(7)\\nWe apply the temperature scaled radius (7) to fit the data in the form\\nR  = R0 (M/M )  .\\n(8)\\nFor the sample of Parsons et al. (2017), we determine best-fit parameters ( , T0) to the mass-radius data of 26 WDs of type DA, all in eclipsing binaries.\\nThe function f (T/T0) in (6), to be discussed further below, will be a power-law comprising the free parameters ( , T0). In a fit to the mass-radius data, these parameters will be considered over a broad range of values\\n0 < T0 < 9 eV, 0 <   < 1.\\n(9)\\nThe characteristic temperature scale T0 is limited to T0 < 9 eV. In this energy range, radii obtain accurately, while beyond, accuracy diminishes. We keep   < 1, reflecting the assumption that temperature has a secondary impact on the radius. Our best-fit is defined by   estimated using ODR (Orthogonal Dis- tance Regression) and, subsequently, the optimal value of   and T0 at the minimum STD and  2 of residuals.\\nFollowing standard practice, our power-laws (6-8) are ana-\\nlyzed by fits to linear trends in the log-log plane to\\nlog R  =   log M + C.\\nIn fits to data by (10),  2 optimizes both the index   in scaling by a power-law in mass and the constant C, while minimizing STD optimizes only  . In the present analysis quantifying the goodness-of-fit according to residual scatter about a trend line (10), the level shift C along the ordinate - absorbing R0 in (6-8) - is safely ignored and it suffices to determine   by minimization of residuals.\\n4. Temperature-normalized mass-radius relations\\nIn the present model-agnostic approach, we explore fits to the data using three temperature-normalized power-laws. To this end, optimize by  2 and STD in our parameter estimation from fits to the sample of Parsons et al. (2017).\\nThe first power-law Relation-1 is\\nI. f (x) = x ,\\nwhere x = T/T0. Here, T0 acts as a constant because of (9). For this reason,   is not affected by a choice of T0. We find\\n  =  0.954,   = 0.195  2 : STD :   =  0.951,   = 0.190\\nwith the minimum  2 = 0.0183 and, respectively, with residual   = 0.03664. The second power-law Relation-2 is\\nII. f (x) = (1 + x)  .\\nIn contrast to Relation-1, Relation-2 includes the zero temper- ature limit of the Chandrasekhar mass-radius relation (1). Ac- cordingly, T0 is no longer ignorable and is determined in the optimization process in fitting (13) to the data. We find\\n  =  0.969,   = 0.389, T0 = 16226  2 : STD :   =  0.965,   = 0.356, T0 = 13896\\nwith the minimum  2 = 0.0159 and, respectively, with residual   = 0.0344. The third power-law Relation-3 is\\nIII. f (x) = 1 + x ,\\nsimilar but not identical to Relation-2. Relation-3 also includes the Chandrasekhar limit of zero temperature and T0 is not ig- norable. We find\\n  =  0.971,   = 0.690, T0 = 66500,  2 : STD :   =  0.965,   = 0.647, T0 = 65914\\n(10)\\n(11)\\n(12)\\n(13)\\n(14)\\n(15)\\n(16)\\nwith the minimum  2 = 0.0161 and, respectively, a residual   = 0.0346.\\nFig. 3 summarizes our three results, each indicated by color: blue, green and red for Relation-1, Relation-2 and Relation- 3, respectively. The curve represents the optimal   with each T0 at the minimum STD ( 2). The junction point shows the common minimum STD ( 2). Both Relation-2 and Relation-3 leave rather similar residuals (in   and  2) for each of Relation- 2 and Relation-3. To rank these two relations, we proceed as follows.\\n5. Ranking relations by Monte Carlo Analysis\\nIn this section, Relation-2 and Relation-3 are ranked for sig-\\nnificance by Monte Carlo (MC) analysis.\\nMC analysis is a useful method for robust parameter estima- tion and ranking relations in the face of measurement uncertain- ties. Though ODR methods can be used also to estimate param- eters, the results do not necessarily agree, making it difficult to rank Relation-2 and Relation-3 for their relative significance.\\nIn this light, we pursue MC analysis by creating synthetic data by randomly selecting samples of varying radius, mass, and temperature within the measurement confidence intervals,\\nXnew = X + N(0,  ).\\nFollowing this procedure, we estimate  ,  , and T0 without con- sidering errors in ODR. Results extended over 5M calculations are used to determine a ranking of Relation-2 and Relation-3 according to STD or  2) (Fig. 4) and infer a probability P of relative significance by counting the total number of times ei- ther one has preferred rank (Table 2). The MC simulation also provides accurate values in the mean of  ,  , and T0 over the total number of iterations.\\nIn our MC analysis, we consider realizations of arrays of 26   3 = 78 entries, comprising mass, radius and tempera- ture of the 26 WDs. As observed quantities, mass, radius and temperature data are independent. An accordingly fair (unbi- ased) draw of realizations extends over random draws from 98 confidence intervals, unconstrained and independently, blind to physical meaning and pre-conceived notions of correlations. In our analysis, the range of allowed values is densely covering by using a very large number of 5M iterations.\\nTable 2 shows the output of our MC analysis. The results indicate that the WD radius is firstly determined by mass more so than temperature. Relation-2 and Relation-3 have similar   values, but   and T0 are notably distinct with otherwise similar residuals in  2 and STD (Figs. 2-5).Table 2 includes Relation-1, results for which are consistent with the above discussion.\\n6. Interpretation of Results\\nEclipsing binaries allow precise measurements of WD mass and radius (Bours et al., 2016; Parsons et al., 2017). How- ever, as in Fig. 2, the theoretical mass-radius relation (1) pro- vides a lower bound. It is generally not the greatest lower bound by significant departures for hot, low-mass white dwarfs\\n(17)\\nFigure 3: Tracks of STD residuals (left panel) and  2 (right panel) for the Relation-1 (blue), Relation-2 (green) and Relation-3 (red) as a function of the normalized temperature power-law index  , following minimization over all T0 in (9). Note that Relation-1 has no explicit dependence on T0. Both cost functions produce very similar results for   and  .\\nTable 2: Monte Carlo analysis on Relations 1-3 with ranking by probability P of having the lowest residual in  2 (left) or STD (right) for the same data (Fig. 4, synthesized over 5M representations).\\nSTD\\nRelation-1 Relation-2 Relation-3 Relation-1 Relation-2 Relation-3\\nR0/R \\n7.6   10 3\\n6.2   10 3\\n5.8   10 3\\n8.4   10 4\\n6.2   10 3\\n5.8   10 3\\n0.951\\n 0.966\\n 0.967\\n0.951\\n 0.965\\n 0.966\\n0.194\\n0.409\\n0.690\\n0.193\\n0.375\\n0.685\\n T0\\n25000\\n19000\\n65000\\nconst\\n15000\\n64000\\n  1%\\n98.7%\\n  1%\\n  1%\\n98.6%\\n  1%\\nFigure 4: Probability of Relation-2 to have a smaller residual in  2 (continuous curve) and STD (dashed curve) than Relation-3 in a MC analysis extending over a large number of synthetic data sets. Both cost functions support the conclusion that Relation-2 is preferred over Relation-3 in providing a model- agnostic fit to the mass-radius data of WDs.\\n(M/M    0.5). The gray region in Fig. 2 (Table 1) is il- lustrative, highlighting a pronounced trend in observed WD radius with temperatures at otherwise very similar masses in M/M  < 0.5. Evidently, this trend cannot be explained by the zero-temperature mass-radius relationship.\\nSeveral theoretical calculations (de Carvalho et al., 2014; Boshkayev, 2018, 2019) have been advanced to explain this de- parture. While rotation and density affects the radius, the ra- dius of relatively dense WDs is not significantly influenced by temperature even though such is more so for low-density or ro- tating WDs compared to their high-density counter parts. Our a model-agnostic study of T0 identify a characteristic temper- ature in the expansion of the radius of the photosphere. It re- veals a consistent trend wherein WDs with higher temperatures exhibit relatively larger radius, clearly apparent in the overall trend (Benvenuto and Althaus, 1999; Panei et al., 2007; Par- sons et al., 2017; Joyce et al., 2018; Zenati et al., 2019; Romero et al., 2019).\\nIn a novel model-agnostic revisit of the mass-radius relation- ship, we quantify this temperature dependence by a temperature scale T0 = (1   2) eV in Relation-2. Relation-2 is found to be statistically more significant than Relation-3 based on our MC analysis ( 4). Over 5M iterations, Fig.4 shows Relation-2 to have a lower  2 and lower   than Relation-3 at a probability of 98.7%, respectively, 98.6% . In the present approach, we circumvent potential systematic uncertainties otherwise present in model-dependent approaches (Parsons et al. 2017 and refer- ences therein).\\nWe summarize our approach in Fig. 5 (A-C). Panel (A) shows the discrepancy between the theoretical mass-radius re- lation at zero temperature (1) and the observed radius. Panel (B) shows a fit to the mass to the un-normalized radius, re- vealing scatter than clearly exceeds that of measurement uncer- tainty. Panel (C) shows the result of a linear relation between the temperature-normalized radius R  and (M/M ) . At rela- tively small residual scatter, this result identifies a temperature scale T0 and a radius primarily determined by mass. Accord- ing to Table 2 and in the notation of (1), we infer a mass-radius relation\\nR = C\\n(cid:32)\\nM M \\n(cid:33) 1/3\\n(18)\\nFigure 5: Mass-radius plots of the data (black dots). Panel (A) highlights the deviation from the theoretical zero-temperature limit (1). Panel (B) highlights the excess scatter in the data following a fit (red line) to the un-normalized radius R   M . Panel (C) shows a fit (green line) to our temperature-normalized radius R    M  in Relation-2 (13). A small residual scatter (cf. Fig. 3) evidences the effectiveness of our normalization in Relation-2, except for three outliers with relatively large observational uncertainties. All three panels A-C include the theoretical relation (blue dotted line). Bottom panels show the adjusted radius in our normalization produced by minimization of  2 (left) and STD (right). The adjustment by our temperature normalization in R  = R/ f (x), x = T/T0, is about 23% (  = 1.76) and 28% (  = 2.05) in Relation-2 and, respectively, Relation-3 in  2 optimization. The same is 24% (  = 1.82) and 29% (  = 2.07) in Relation-2, respectively, Relation-3 in STD optimization. This adjustment is most relevant at high temperatures.\\nwith the temperature-dependent expansion of an atmosphere in- cluded in\\nC   C0\\n(cid:32)\\n1 + T T0\\n(cid:33)1/3 (cid:32)\\nM M \\n(cid:33) 2/3\\naccording to Relation-2, parameterized by STD in the approxi- mations   =  0.965    1 and   = 0.375   1/3.\\n(19)\\nOur model-agnostic analysis hereby effectively reveals the presence of non-degenerate atmosphere, sufficiently massive and opaque, to account for the observed temperature sensitivity in Fig. 2 parameterized by above-mentioned T0. Indeed, further confirmation can be found in consistency of the present Parsons et al. (2017) data with the detailed model for H atmospheres of B edard et al. (2020).\\n7. Conclusions and Outlook\\nWe summarize the apparent mass-radius relation (18) with temperature dependent coefficient (19) due to this atmosphere by including Relation-2 as a factor modifying C0 in (19).\\nA principal outcome of our model-independent study is a temperature scale T0 = 1   2 eV in temperature sensitivity of the photospheric radius of the WDs of type DA in Parsons et al. (2017), shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in (18-19).\\nT0 derives from 1.6 eV and 1.3 eV according to  2 and, re- spectively, STD in fits of Relation-2 to the data. T0 appears to be particularly relevant to low mass M/M    0.5 in the present sample.\\nWhile the Parsons et al. (2017) sample of WDs covers a size- able range in masses with distinct temperature sensitivity be- low M/M    0.5 and above M/M    0.5, they nevertheless are of relatively high mass-density      0 (Fig. 6). Cru- cially, densities for the entire at hand are above the threshold  0 = 105 g cm 3 above which the mass-radius relation of the degenerate core is expected to be insensitive to temperature (Boshkayev, 2018). In this sense, the present sample is rela- tively homogeneous and does not test temperature sensitivity of the core beyond what is expected from (1).\\nFor the above-mentioned low-mass WDs, a non-degenerate atmosphere effectively insulates a core at super-Eddington tem- peratures (4) from the observed sub-Eddington temperatures T by virtue of an atmosphere that is sufficiently massive and opaque. In the following scaling, we shall ignore a potential role of a corona due to magnetic fields (Aznar Cuadrado et al., 2004; Jordan et al., 2007; Ferrario et al., 2020).\\nFollowing  2, the Eddington temperature introduces a scale height hE by virtue of thermal kinetic energy of the ions, distinct from escape by radiation pressure. For a hydrogen atmosphere,\\nFigure 6: (Top panel.) For the WD sample of Parsons et al. (2017), shown are the expected relative expansion of a non-degenerate atmosphere, sufficiently massive and opaque, surrounding a degenerate core based on super-Eddington temperature Tc inferred from the Koester (1976) correlation to the observed temperature T (Fig. 1). The Parsons et al. (2017) sample satisfies TEdd     TcT , reconciling Tc   TEdd with T   TEdd, leaving T on the order of a few eV. (Lower panel.) For the entire Parsons et al. (2017) sample, the mass- densities of the core according to the theoretical zero-temperature relationship (1) are above the threshold 105 g cm 3 of Boshkayev (2018), where temperature sensitivity is negligible.\\nwe have\\nhE  \\nkBTEdd mpg\\n= 13 km R2\\n0.02 M 1\\n0.5   0.3%RWD.\\nBy high thermal conductivity, the core is believed to be at an essentially uniform temperature. As a result, the atmosphere assumes a mean temperature  TEdd with      . By (20), this implies a height\\nH =   hE   10% RWD.\\nThis expected height (Fig. 6) introduces a radial expansion qualitatively consistent with the data (Fig. 5).\\nIn this light, the relatively modest characteristic temperature T0 = 1   2 eV in (18-19) can be identified with the core temper- ature higher by a factor of Tc/T   (TEdd/T )2 = O based on Figs. 1-2 and  2.\\n(cid:16)\\n103(cid:17)\\nThe heat transport from core to surface in such atmospheres gives rise to a complex mass-radius relationship, here described by (18-19). This appears to be particular relevant to low-mass WDs, essentially below the mean of the WD mass distribution. Above, the relatively high-mass WDs appear to follow the the- oretical mass-radius relation (1), evidencing the absence of an atmosphere and/or a relatively low temperature core. The origin of this discrepancy appears to be beyond the present considera- tions, that might involve a distinct composition and associated formation history. Derived for WDs of type DA, our results may serve as a reference for similar model-independent analysis of WDs of different type.\\n(20)\\n(21)\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors thank the anonymous reviewer for constructive comments which greatly contributed to clarity of presentation, and thank M.A. Abchouyeh for stimulating discussions.

We present a model-independent study of the observed mass-radius relationship in WD binaries of Parsons et al. (2017), listing data over a broad temperature range up to about 60,000 K (5 eV). The data show an appreciable temperature sen- sitivity with pronounced intrinsic scatter (beyond measurement uncertainty) for the canonical He-models with proton to neutron ratio 1:1.

As such, they are quite numerous. The Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) contains 359,073 WD candidates (Gentile Fusillo et al., 2021). EDR3 extends the survey of 29,294 WDs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16 (DR 16) by over an order of magnitude with 25,176 WDs in both surveys. WDs are variously classified by their atmospheric composition (Gen- tile Fusillo et al. 2021). Most are of type DA characterized by a dominance of hydrogen lines in their spectra. It reveals an opaque hydrogen atmosphere, whose observed temperatures are well below the Eddington limit (Fig. 1). WDs have a distinct mass-radius relationship with a lower bound defined by electron degeneracy pressure (Str omgren, 1939).', chunk_index=2, num_tokens=264, metadata={'section_titles': ['Tc    TEdd', 'Acknowledgements', 'nificance by Monte Carlo (MC) analysis.', '40 T TEdd', 'with', 'R = C', 'Keywords: white dwarfs, mass-radius relation, Chandrasekhar', 'R f (T/T0)', 'Abstract', 'Preprint submitted to New Astronomy', 'C   C0', 'Teff [K]', 'STD', 'R = R0', 'const', 'Object', 'References', 'where', 'aPhysics and Astronomy, Sejong University, 209 Neungdong-ro, 05006, Seoul, South Korea', 'Progress in Physics 53, 837.', 'kBTEdd mpg', 'Boshkayev, K., 2019.', 'Relation-1 Relation-2 Relation-3 Relation-1 Relation-2 Relation-3', 'Xnew = X + N(0,  ).', 'R = C0', 'log R  =   log M + C.'], 'pages': [1]}), ResponseChunk(id='chunk_4233fedc-14c2-48e1-9a5e-703c3f589913', content='It is described by the equation of state (EoS) of de- generacy pressure of a Fermi gas, the relativistic limit of which defines the Chandrasekhar mass-limit.

Moreover, at sufficiently high density, the mass-radius relationship of the core becomes uni- versal, independent of the details of the EoS. Instead, the origin of temperature sensitivity in the mass- radius relationship may be found in a non-degenerate atmo- sphere, if present. In particular, a finite temperature sensitivity is expected from an atmosphere about a core at super-Eddington temperatures - allowed for a sufficiently massive and optically thick atmospheres (Fontaine et al., 2001). A variety of studies have been conducted to find solutions thereto and gain a deeper understanding of, e.g., an H enve- lope and/or evolution models depending on core composition (Hamada and Salpeter, 1961; Hearn and Mewe, 1976; Verbunt and Rappaport, 1988; Benvenuto and Althaus, 1999; Fontaine et al., 2001; Panei et al., 2007; Boshkayev et al., 2015; Par- sons et al., 2017; Kepler et al., 2019; Pei, 2022).', chunk_index=7, num_tokens=290, metadata={'section_titles': ['Tc    TEdd', 'Acknowledgements', 'nificance by Monte Carlo (MC) analysis.', '40 T TEdd', 'with', 'R = C', 'Keywords: white dwarfs, mass-radius relation, Chandrasekhar', 'R f (T/T0)', 'Abstract', 'Preprint submitted to New Astronomy', 'C   C0', 'Teff [K]', 'STD', 'R = R0', 'const', 'Object', 'References', 'where', 'aPhysics and Astronomy, Sejong University, 209 Neungdong-ro, 05006, Seoul, South Korea', 'Progress in Physics 53, 837.', 'kBTEdd mpg', 'Boshkayev, K., 2019.', 'Relation-1 Relation-2 Relation-3 Relation-1 Relation-2 Relation-3', 'Xnew = X + N(0,  ).', 'R = C0', 'log R  =   log M + C.'], 'pages': [1]}), ResponseChunk(id='chunk_46240803-59ae-4660-bc8d-fe5fff0a0d05', content='Among these studies, various convection theories have been advanced, also to explain cooling times and evolutionary processes of WDs in- cluding the thermal insulation provided by their non-degenerate atmospheres. For instance, hot WDs in SDSS DR12 have been analyzed with models of cooling and atmospheres (B edard et al., 2020). Non-Local Thermal Equilibrium (non-LTE) atmospheres and synthetic WD spectra reveal a correlation between surface grav- ity and effective temperature. These modeled approaches, however, are intricate with po- tentially systematic uncertainties in the detailed structure of non-degenerate atmospheres, mediating heat transport by radi- ation and convection (B edard, 2024). For this reason, we set out the present model-agnostic study based on spectroscopic and photometric data, to further our understanding of the mass- radius relationship (Tremblay et al., 2017; Boshkayev et al., 2016). For the recent sample of 26 WDs of Parsons et al.

(2017) sample, the mass- densities of the core according to the theoretical zero-temperature relationship (1) are above the threshold 105 g cm 3 of Boshkayev (2018), where temperature sensitivity is negligible. we have hE kBTEdd mpg = 13 km R2 0.02 M 1 0.5   0.3%RWD.', chunk_index=27, num_tokens=299, metadata={'section_titles': [], 'pages': []}), ResponseChunk(id='chunk_ff7de32e-f1dd-4578-b643-cdd62de0fff2', content='By high thermal conductivity, the core is believed to be at an essentially uniform temperature. As a result, the atmosphere assumes a mean temperature  TEdd with      . By (20), this implies a height H =   hE   10% RWD. This expected height (Fig. 6) introduces a radial expansion qualitatively consistent with the data (Fig. 5). In this light, the relatively modest characteristic temperature T0 = 1   2 eV in (18-19) can be identified with the core temper- ature higher by a factor of Tc/T   (TEdd/T )2 = O based on Figs. 1-2 and  2. (cid:16) 103(cid:17) The heat transport from core to surface in such atmospheres gives rise to a complex mass-radius relationship, here described by (18-19). This appears to be particular relevant to low-mass WDs, essentially below the mean of the WD mass distribution. Above, the relatively high-mass WDs appear to follow the the- oretical mass-radius relation (1), evidencing the absence of an atmosphere and/or a relatively low temperature core.
